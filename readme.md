##Voronoi WebGL

###What this is:
A webgl visualization of a voronoi diagram as it is generated by Fortune's algorithm. (Kind of)

###Code Structure:
The structure of this code is loosely based off of two books on Javascript from the series You Don't Know Javascript. The primiary influence comes from the book This & Object Prototypes, which eschews object (or class/inheritance-based design patterns) in favor of a pattern referred to as Objects Linked to Other Objects (OLOO). OLOO emphasizes behavior delegation and illustrates how a sort of object heirarchy can be created without using "pseudo"-classes or object prototypes.

In this project specifically, the main file is index.js.  This file adds the buttons for the simulation and creates a webgl object from the WebGl function in webgl_render.js. Webgl_render.js is where the bulk of the rendering work is done. The webgl function returns initializes the shaders and creates the canvas context. It returns an object with the functions `scan()`, `tick()`, `addPoint()` and `reset()` among a few others. 


To run locally:
`npm install`
`node beefy.js`

(If the changes made in index.js aren't being reflected in the browser, make sure the script in index.html is scripts/index.js)

To make a new bundle file:
`browserify scripts/index.js>scripts/bundle.js -t brfs`

point your browser to localhost:9966
